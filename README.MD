# Introduction

Hello! we are Celer. Have you ever been frustrated by the slowness and hassle of communication with companies? Have you ever felt lost in a maze of channels and filters? Well, our company has the solution! We've created a platform that uses artificial intelligence to automate and accelerate communication between companies and their customers.

# Problem

The problem that many companies face is that communications with customers are often slow and cumbersome. Imagine needing help and having to go through different channels and filters to reach someone who can assist you. This can be frustrating and can take a lot of time. Additionally, hiring someone to exclusively handle this work can be very expensive, which means that many companies simply don't have the resources to do it.

# Solution

Our solution is a complete platform that uses artificial intelligence. It's capable of receiving messages through different media such as Discord, WhatsApp, email, etc. and categorizing them to determine which department they belong to. If it's a common problem with a replicable solution, our AI will automatically respond. If not, the AI will send a message to the customer informing them that their request has been received and will be attended to soon. Meanwhile, the AI will summarize and send it to the corresponding department.

# Functioning

Our platform is multi-platform and extremely modular. It has three parts that work synchronously. First, we have independent receivers running on each communication medium. Second, we have the API, which receives the data, performs ETL processing, and applies different AI technologies. And finally, we have the platform to answer messages, which connects to everything else only through the API.

# Benefits

Our platform offers several benefits:

It's extremely fast, which means that customers can receive responses in seconds instead of hours or days.
It's more intuitive, as customers don't have to go through different channels and filters to find the right person.
It's available all day, every day, which means that customers can receive help at any time.
Request management is much faster and more efficient.
