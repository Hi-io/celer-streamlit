# Introduction

Hello! we are CelerConnect. Have you ever been frustrated by the slowness and hassle of communication with companies? Have you ever felt lost in a maze of channels and filters? Well, our company has the solution! We've created a platform that uses artificial intelligence to automate and accelerate communication between companies and their customers.

# Problem

The problem that many companies face is that communications with customers are often slow and cumbersome. Imagine needing help and having to go through different channels and filters to reach someone who can assist you. This can be frustrating and can take a lot of time. Additionally, hiring someone to exclusively handle this work can be very expensive, which means that many companies simply don't have the resources to do it.

# Solution

Our solution is a complete platform that uses artificial intelligence. It's capable of receiving messages through different media such as Discord, WhatsApp, email, etc. and categorizing them to determine which department they belong to. If it's a common problem with a replicable solution, our AI will automatically respond. If not, the AI will send a message to the customer informing them that their request has been received and will be attended to soon. Meanwhile, the AI will summarize and send it to the corresponding department.

# Functioning

Our platform is multi-platform and extremely modular. It has three parts that work synchronously. First, we have independent receivers running on each communication medium. Second, we have the API, which receives the data, performs ETL processing, and applies different AI technologies. And finally, we have the platform to answer messages, which connects to everything else only through the API.

# Benefits

Our platform offers several benefits:

It's extremely fast, which means that customers can receive responses in seconds instead of hours or days.
It's more intuitive, as customers don't have to go through different channels and filters to find the right person.
It's available all day, every day, which means that customers can receive help at any time.
Request management is much faster and more efficient.

# Unanswered Message Processing API

The Unanswered Message Processing API is a powerful tool that automates the processing of unanswered messages. It extracts data from the database of message requests and uses Tech-davinci003 technology to extract detailed information from the message, summarize it, and identify the department to which it belongs. The API provides real-time feedback on the status of incoming messages, making it easier to manage and prioritize them. Additionally, it can be customized to meet specific requirements, making it adaptable to different use cases.

Benefits:

Automates the processing of unanswered messages, which saves time and reduces errors.
Provides real-time feedback on the status of incoming messages, making it easier to manage and prioritize them.
Identifies the department to which the message belongs, making it easier to route the message to the appropriate recipient.
Automatically detects unanswered messages to ensure they are processed promptly.
Provides AI-powered solutions to respond to emails and offer the best possible solution to the problem at hand.

# Email Viewer

Email Viewer is another tool that automates the process of monitoring an email inbox for general queries. It extracts message details and sends them to an API for evaluation. The API evaluates the message based on a set of criteria to determine if it should be approved or rejected. If approved, the message details are loaded into the system for further processing. If rejected, the system takes appropriate action based on the error code returned by the API.

Benefits:

Automates the process of monitoring an email inbox for general queries.
Reduces the need for manual intervention, which saves time and reduces errors.
Provides real-time feedback on the status of incoming messages, making it easier to manage and prioritize them.
Can be customized to meet specific requirements, making it adaptable to different use cases.

Celer's communication automation platform provides a complete solution for companies looking to improve their communication with customers. By using artificial intelligence to automate and accelerate communication, our platform provides real-time feedback on the status of incoming messages and reduces the need for manual intervention, saving time and reducing errors. The Unanswered Message Processing API and Email Viewer are just two examples of the tools we offer that can be customized to meet specific requirements, making them adaptable to different use cases.
